# My `bin` Folder
Sources for small tools in my personal bin folder.
I may or may not need them, but I'm making them anyway.
All tools are currently WIP (works in progress) and may-or-may-not do anything what-so-ever.
All tools are meant to be used in Linux only. More specifically Ubuntu.

### momo (Mouse Monitor)

### ntime (New Time)
Simple tool to time program execution

### wordcount (Word Count)
