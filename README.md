# My `bin` Folder
Sources for small tools in my personal bin folder.
I may or may not need them, but I'm making them anyway.
All tools are currently WIP (works in progress) and may-or-may-not do anything what-so-ever.
All tools are meant to be used in Linux only. More specifically Ubuntu.

## Tools
### momo (Mouse Monitor)
Gives simple mouse information from X11

### rfciph (Rail Fence Cipher)
Basic tool to apply a rail fence cipher to a text string

### wordcount (Word Count)
Counts instances of words from an input string, pipe, or file
